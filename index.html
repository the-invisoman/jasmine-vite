        <h2>üíó The Things I Appreciate üíó</h2>
        <p>Dear Jasmine,</p>

        <p>
          I just wanted to take a moment to express my love and appreciation for
          you. Every moment we spend together is filled with so much joy and
          happiness.
        </p>

        <p>
          I love the way you always make me feel loved and appreciated. Your
          kindness and compassion towards me knows no bounds and I feel so lucky
          to have you as my partner. I know I can always count on you to support
          me, listen to me, and be there for me no matter what.
        </p>
        <p>
          With you, I feel so comfortable and accepted for who I am. I love the
          way we can laugh and joke together and just enjoy each other's
          company. But your also mature and understanding, your willing to
          comprimise for the relationship, take things slow, and the ability to
          take accountability. Everything may not be perfect but they're not
          suppose to be.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also appreciate all the little things you do for me, like making me
          food and trying to take care of me by doing the little things. Or like
          when you always make time to call me everyday and send me tik toks
          when I'm at work. The way you prioritize my pleasure over your own.You
          always know just how to make me feel special and loved.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are my gorgeous princess and I can't wait to see what the future
          holds for us and to spend even more time together. I love you more and
          more every day and I am so grateful to have you in my life.
        </p>
        <p>Forever yours,<br />Emmanuel Urias</p>

        <h2>üå∏ My little flower üå∏</h2>

        <p>
          Jasmine, my love, you are the sun in my sky<br />
          The river that runs through my soul You are the air that I breathe,
          the beat of my heart<br />
          Without you, my world would fall apart<br />
          Your touch is gentle, your kiss is sweet Whenever you're near, my
          heart skips a beat<br />
          I love your smile and your laugh<br />
          especially after I have'nt seen you in a while<br />
          Time flies by when I'm with you<br />
          can't wait to see it fly by to next Christmas
        </p>

        <h2>You are my world üåé</h2>

        <p>
          My dearest Jasmine, I am writing to tell you just how much you mean to
          me. From the moment I met you, I knew that you were the one for me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your beauty, grace, and kindness have captured my heart, and I am so
          grateful to have you in my life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every day, I am amazed by your strength, intelligence, and compassion.
          You inspire me to be a better person, and I am constantly in awe of
          the love and support you give me. I am so thankful for the joy and
          happiness you bring into my life.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are the best gift from santa that I could have asked for. And I am
          eternally grateful to god for bringing me you into my life. You are my
          heaven, my peace on earth. I LOVE YOU
        </p>
        <p>Love,<br />Emmanuel</p>

        <h2>The thought behind this ü§î</h2>

        <p>
          This gift has a deeper meaning that you probably haven't realized.
          These objects have hidden meanings that represent our love.<br />
          The white ring stands for the way your purity and kindness surrounds
          and circles my heart. And how you light up my day everytime you make
          my phone ring.<br />
          The snowflakes represent the uniqueness to you and the experiences I
          have with you since every snowflake is unique. And I am surrounded by
          thousands of them. They also remind me of the best part of winter
          which is the snow, something about it makes me feel comfortable and
          happier even though it's cold.<br />
          The moon represents the rhythm of time together, because the moon
          raises and lowers the tides everyday, and changes the way it reflects
          light every month, the moon is beautiful and feminine like you it
          reminds me of smooth calming light that takes care of you in the dark
          and something you can look at and admire unlike the sun.<br />
          Last but not least the space in which is infinite it is a scary yet
          intrigueing place. It is full of potential, potential in both good and
          bad ways. It makes you realize your insignificance in the ions of time
          but also through that insignificance it reminds you that you are not
          just a droplet of water in the ocean but a droplet forming a part of
          the ocean. It is unfathomly huge and baron but in it lies you and me
          and our love for each other.<br />
          The bright red heart is my heart which I am giving to you. And if you
          wonder why red, red isn't just the cliche color to make a heart, red
          also represents deep burning passion, dangerous but also rewarding and
          filled with bliss if used correctly. And it's circled by the ring and
          moon which to me are you.<br />
          As you scrolled and saw my heart fade away don't forget that it's
          still there and that you remain spinning around it keeping it warm
          even if your only in my mind.
        </p>

        <h2>‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî• Desire ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•</h2>

        <p>
          I crave your mouth, your voice, your hair.<br />
          Silent and starving, I try to drown my hunger with my imagination<br />.
          Bread does not nourish me, dawn disrupts me, all day I dream for the
          liquid measure of your steps.<br />
          I hunger for your sleek laugh, your hands the color of a tropical
          beach, hunger for the colored and painted stones of your fingernails,
          I want to eat your skin like a whole almond.<br />
          I want to eat the sunbeam flaring in your lovely body, the sovereign
          nose of your arrogant face, I want to eat the fleeting shade of your
          lashes, and I pace around hungry, sniffing the twilight, hunting for
          you, for your hot heart.<br />
          I throb, I crave, I dream and desire to feel the warmth inside you.<br />
          To feel you show your love through your mouth in ways beyond your
          words<br />
          To feel your tightness around me and to feel your heart beat through
          your warm and wet second heart<br />
          Words can't describe the urges I fight when I'm with you<br />
          I feel like an barbarian the way my passion and desire for you is so
          strong it makes me want to hurt you<br />
          Your soft lips, warm body, and hot breath I can't help myself<br />
          I want every hole with a burning passion<br />
          But more than that I want you
        </p>
